## 🧠 Problem Statement

In the telecom industry, where customers can switch providers easily, the annual churn rate ranges between 15–25%. Given that acquiring a new customer is 5–10 times more expensive than retaining an existing one, customer retention has become a critical business goal.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on customer usage patterns, behavior, and payment history. The dataset contains ~170 features for each customer, and the goal is to accurately identify those at risk of churning to enable proactive retention strategies.
